# cti-rss-parser
CTI source RSS feeds parser

This simple Python script is created for collecting RSS feeds from a CTI source.
First need to import the necessary libraries for handling and parsing RSS feeds. This can typically be done using the feedparser library.

Next, you would need to specify the URL of the CTI RSS feed that you want to collect. This can be done by creating a variable and assigning the feed's URL to it, like this:

cti_rss_url = "http://www.XXX.com/cti/feed.xml"

Then, you can use the feedparser library to parse the feed and extract the information you need. This can be done using the parse() method, like this:

cti_feed = feedparser.parse(cti_rss_url)

Once you have parsed the feed, you can access the individual entries using the entries property of the cti_feed object. This will return a list of entries, each of which contains information about a specific threat.

Then, you iterate over the list of entries and extract the information you need, such as the threat title, description, and URL.

A simple Python script for collecting CTI RSS feeds might look something as follow:

import feedparser

cti_rss_url = "http://www.XXX.com/cti/feed.xml"
cti_feed = feedparser.parse(cti_rss_url)

for entry in cti_feed.entries:
    print("Threat Title:", entry.title)
    print("Threat Description:", entry.description)
    print("Threat URL:", entry.link)
    print()

Finally, you can then customize the script to suit your specific needs, such as by adding additional processing or filtering of the collected data.
